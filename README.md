# SalamaThanksV2 Beta Testing

The goal of this beta testing round is to gather consumer-based comments for the first version of the SalamaThanks Web Application. This round spans five (5) days, starting on May 24, 2022 (Tuesday), up until May 28, 2022 (Saturday). The feedback form will be open until May 28, 11:59 PM.


The web app should be able to:
- receive input and return output
- swap languages using the two-arrow button
- clear input using the X button
- copy output using the duplicate button
- receive speech input and convert to text
- return speech output from text
- redirect to the beta testing forms using the feedback button


The current limitations of the web app are:
- a character limit of 250
- inability to receive speech input on some browsers


Changes from the previous version are the following:
- Improved translations
- Character count
- Alpha version of mobile access
